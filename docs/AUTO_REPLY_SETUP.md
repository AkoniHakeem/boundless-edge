# Auto-Reply Email Setup Guide

## Overview

The auto-reply feature sends an immediate confirmation email to customers when they submit your contact form. This provides excellent customer experience and sets professional expectations.

## 📧 Auto-Reply Templates

### HTML Template: `docs/auto-reply-template.html`

- **Professional Design**: Matches your brand with gradients and styling
- **Customer-Focused**: Thank you message with clear next steps
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Confirmation checkmark
  - Inquiry summary
  - What happens next timeline
  - Response time expectations
  - Contact methods for urgent needs

### Text Template: `docs/auto-reply-template.txt`

- **Simple Format**: For email clients that don't support HTML
- **Same Information**: All key details in plain text format

## 🔧 EmailJS Setup for Auto-Reply

### Step 1: Create Auto-Reply Template

1. Go to your EmailJS dashboard
2. Navigate to "Email Templates"
3. Click "Create New Template"
4. Name it "Customer Auto-Reply" or similar
5. Copy the HTML from `docs/auto-reply-template.html`
6. Paste it into the EmailJS template editor (HTML mode)
7. Save and note the **Template ID**

### Step 2: Configure Template Variables

The auto-reply uses the same variables as the business notification:

```
{{from_name}} - Customer's name
{{from_email}} - Customer's email
{{company}} - Customer's company
{{project_type}} - Project type selected
{{submission_date}} - Formatted timestamp
```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Add the auto-reply template ID to your `.env` file:

```env
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id_here
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_business_template_id_here
EMAILJS_AUTO_REPLY_TEMPLATE_ID=your_auto_reply_template_id_here
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

### Step 4: Email Flow

When a customer submits the contact form:

1. **Business Notification** → Sent to `dev@boundlesedge.com`

   - Uses `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - Contains customer inquiry details
   - For your team to review and respond

2. **Customer Auto-Reply** → Sent to customer's email
   - Uses `EMAILJS_AUTO_REPLY_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - Confirms receipt of their inquiry
   - Sets expectations and provides next steps

### Graceful Fallback

// Auto-reply is optional
if (isAutoReplyConfigured()) {
  // Send auto-reply to customer
} else {
  // Continue with just business notification
}
```
